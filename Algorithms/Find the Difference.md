```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {character}
 */
var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
    const m1 = {};
    const m2 = {};
    
    s.split('').forEach(c => {
        m1[c] ? m1[c]++ : m1[c] = 1;
    });
    
    t.split('').forEach(c => {
        m2[c] ? m2[c]++ : m2[c] = 1;
    });
    
    return Object.keys(m2).find(c => m2[c] != m1[c]);
};
```

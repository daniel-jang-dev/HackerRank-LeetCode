### [2997. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array XOR Equal to K](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-xor-equal-to-k/)
```Typescript
function minOperations(nums: number[], k: number): number {
  let currXor = 0;
  for (const n of nums) {
    currXor ^= n;
  }

  let diff = currXor ^ k;
  let operations = 0;

  while (diff !== 0) {
    operations += diff & 1;
    diff >>>= 1;
  }

  return operations;
};
```
```Python3
from typing import List

def min_operations(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    current_xor = 0
    for num in nums:
        current_xor ^= num

    diff = current_xor ^ k
    flips = 0

    while diff:
        flips += diff & 1
        diff >>= 1

    return flips
```

```javascript
// Initial
var countOdds = function(low, high) {
    const diff = high - low;
    return  diff % 2 === 1 ? 
            Math.ceil(diff / 2) :
            (diff / 2 + (low % 2 === 1 ? 1 : 0));
};

// Refer to lee215
var countOdds = (low, high)  => Math.floor((high + 1) / 2) - Math.floor(low / 2);
```

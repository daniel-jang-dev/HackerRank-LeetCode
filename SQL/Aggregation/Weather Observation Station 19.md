Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

    SELECT ROUND(SQRT(POW(MAX(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N),2) + POW(MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W),2)), 4) FROM station;
